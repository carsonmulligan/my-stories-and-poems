Just read for about an hour about the Vipassana meditation retreat. The living conditions don’t look as good as I thought they were luxury isn’t a good thing. Planning tickets to go back home, and Travel plans tonight from Hong Kong. Is it bad to think fit more than three weeks at home wouldn’t be good? Who knows? Also caught up on some of the daily Stoic readings found a cool one from November 26.
