吾有十畝田。
種在南山破。
青松四五樹。
綠豆兩三顆。
熱即池中浴。
涼便岸上歌。
遨遊自取足。
誰能奈我何。

“I have ten acres. 
Planted at the back of the Zhongshan Mountain. 
Four or five Qingsong Trees. 
Two or three Beanstalks. 
If it’s hot I’ll jump in the pond. 
If it’s cold I’ll sing songs by the shore.
Traveling or at home I am with myself.
Who could tell me what to do?”

# The Daily Oklahoman
----

It was windy when I came in. I told the guard somebody turned the wind on and forgot to turn it off. He said the wind makes this visit special. 

Senator Bergstrom was there with the guards and Senator Allen. They said call us by our names not Senator this or that and then we had coffee. Bergstrom adjusted his bolo tie and Mary Boren came out of the gift shop. We tipped our hats and said hello. 

“Who took our hats?” Allen asked Bergstrom. 

“Brooks, Bullard, or Burns, I reckon.” Bergstrom said. 

“Coleman, Dahm, and Dossett have new hats, no?” 

“Indeed.” 

“Two Dossetts?”

“Yes. Married or related I don't know.”

Dugger strolls past the pair. Past Boren, Brooks, Bullard, Burns and the rest. Coleman, Dahm, and the Dossetts on the other side. 

“A family reunion? No?” Dugger asks with a smile. 

The Dossetts laugh. The rest tip their hats and smile back. Dugger answers his phone.

“Yes, ah, yes, okay. Oh the first floor. Why, I too...”

Garvin throws a rock past Bullard and Boren, shattering the window of the gift shop.   

Chuck Hall is hit with a piece of glass, picks it up off the ground and shaves the sides of Warren Hamilton’s beard off with the shard. John Haste picks up _The Oklahoman_ and reads patiently waiting for his turn. Carri Hicks takes a seat next to Haste and asks if he signed in online. 

“I left my phone at home.”

“Ah. Long drive.”

“Yes, yes.”

Brett Howard waits in line now because there is a line.

“What’s the line for?” Howard asks the group.

“Liberation.” Replies Shane Jett.

The group nods. Haste produces two more copies of _The Oklahoman_ and the trio reads away. 

“We’ll pass the funnies around each when we’re done so everybody can have a look.” Says Haste. 

“This is democracy,” Chris Kidd said. 

Kidd desires to wait in line but lacks a current edition of _The Oklahoman. _ He sets off to acquire a copy. Julia Kirt is just the senator he needs to see. He sets out for Kirt’s office on the fifth floor. A treacherous journey from the first. 

At this point I realized the best seat in the house was the press box. _Visiting press_ seems appropriate. I must get my hands on a copy of _The Oklahoman_. They say it possesses some magical power. Something clicks when I see Chris Kidd push the button on the elevator. I know I must run up the stairs to the fifth floor to find the last current edition in the building in Julia Kirt’s office. This edition still has the funnies.

He woke to a beam of light. The distant sound of a tanker horn filled the air. He opened his eyes and felt he knew the way.

“You mean this flight?” The airline desk employee pointed out the window.  

Jean Pierre thanked the woman and smiled. He asked about the nearest hotels. The woman gave him some options, he thanked her again, then went to the Narita train terminal. Jean Pierre walked with his carry-on backpack (all he brought with him) out of the airport and to the train terminal.

Now out in Tokyo it was about 11pm. He dropped off his bag at a capsule hostel and went to the bars near the statue of the famous dog in Shibuya. The taxis were a blast from the past. People smoked cigarettes inside 1950's style diners, tourists were all around, faces in the street were lit up by large transforming LED   ked down. Aki jumped in and did not flail about on the surface. He laid himself back to the bottom under the dock, and there with his eyes opened waited and caught no coy.

Aki back on the dock the water became calm again. The coy returned and the two men talked about rice.

## Chapter Four
----
The local rice master practiced a specific form of zen agriculture, called _do nothing_ from the Daosist _wu-wei_.  Whereby the practictioner puts seeds down together, seeds that grow symbiotic plants in balance. 

Barley and rice are planted among eachother on small plots of land in fall and in spring. The same vegetables in the hills. To cover the fields the farmer uses crimson clover. It shoots nitrogen into the soil and keeps weeds out. Brings in nice pollinators, helps prevent plant disease. That's really it. There is still much labor involved. Direct seeding — without using a large till, and manual weeding where necessary. The process revolves around a circular inlaid tea cooking dojo pit. Akihiro Fujimori brought Jean Pierre to the Masanobu farm.

Masanobu knew the tea ceremony and served it very well. This night he served tea from the pot of a visiting Britisher, a hiking thermos stamped MADE IN ENGLAND with the year 1945. The Britisher was tall and looked more like a Scott, a good highlander from the movies. He had a funny name, Dougal Roscoe Cameron III. The group accepted the tea as it was served in Masanobu's style. The pot was inspected by all and passed around the room. Each person to make a comment on the pot and pass it along. Masanobu last, Akihiro first.

“A year to remember.” Aki said.
“A canteen of tin.” Jean Pierre said.

----

“Burmese tin.” Said the Britisher.
“Japanese tea.” Said Masanobu. 

Tea was poured and handed across the circular inlaid fire part. Paper walls gave the feeling of sitting inside, tatami mats, clean as a whistle, under clean dojo clothes and clean feet.
