吾有十畝田。
種在南山破。
青松四五樹。
綠豆兩三顆。
熱即池中浴。
涼便岸上歌。
遨遊自取足。
誰能奈我何。


_“I have ten acres. _
_Planted at the back of the Zhongshan Mountain. _
_Four or five Qingsong Trees. _
_Two or three Beanstalks. _
_If it’s hot I’ll jump in the pond. _
_If it’s cold I’ll sing songs by the shore._
_Traveling or at home I am with myself._
_Who could tell me what to do?”_



## Chapter One
----
A moving slimmer of light woke Jean-Pierre from under the tree. He looked out over the port's afternoon lethargy. He looked down at the grass that felt like Great Lakes fescue and laughed, how many PhD theses have been written about whatever the scientific name of this Japanese grass was. He moved onto his belly, forearms on the ground, face just above the grass parted the grass to let the light shine onto the soil. Jean-Pierre saw the small rocks, thought about the PH levels, the nitrogen, all the things people like him measured. He knew this place was healthy though and knew that the tree and the grass were all apart of the same system. He knew this intuitively and heard the long, low bellow of a tanker horn. He opened his eyes and felt he knew the way. 

The last day of the conference, the attendees were packing up, saying goodbyes, and many had already left. Jean-Pierre's flight back was delayed from 13:45 to 17:30 and he was not fazed. He felt a smooth state of ease since he had heard the tanker horn the day before. Around 13:00 a group of Dutch scientists, with whom he'd worked closely this week, but also for many years back in Europe, came to the airport to fly to Amsterdam at 19:00. Of the twenty or so in the group, Jean Pierre tagged up with seven or eight of them at the airport bar in this isolated, quiet part of the Narita airport. They drank beer and talked shop — exchanging stories about office politics, research trips, ladies, and sports. At 16:30 Jean-Pierre went to check his flight. 

“You mean this flight?” The airline desk employee pointed out the window. 

Jean Pierre thanked the woman and smiled. He asked about the nearest hotels. The woman gave him some options, he thanked her again, then went to the Narita train terminal. Jean Pierre walked with his carry-on backpack (all he brought with him) out of the airport and to the train terminal.

Now out in Tokyo it was about 11pm. He dropped off his bag at a capsule hostel and went to the bars near the statue of the famous dog in Shibuya. The taxis were a blast from the past. People smoked cigarettes inside 1950's style diners, tourists were all around, faces in the street were lit up by large transforming LED advertisements on the buildings. Triangles, rectangles, spinning, circles, music from many parts of the world, techno-lofi beat music, American music. 

Next day Jean Pierre didn't check flights. He went back to sleep in the capsule and laughed a little. He thought about the paper he presented with Fujimori on an enhanced understanding of rice genetics. He was proud of the paper and of what he and Fujimori had acheived, though here in the capsule he thought about what it felt like to wake up under the tree and to see the Great Lakes fescue for the first time, and know what it was without looking it up — knowing that the system was working, even that his sleeping there made the whole thing work — thinking about this he laughed and made plans to visit his friend Fujimori. 

## Chapter Two

----
There was still much research to be done. For now it could be done remotely. Jean Pierre also realized he could spend more time in the field. He made a plan to stay for six weeks longer. Along the way he would decide to do away with the research entirely as it existed for publishing papers. Fujimori would realize that also. For now Jean Pierre took the train to Fukuoka and drafted an email to his dissertation advisor in Paris. 

_I have decided to extend my stay in Japan and will stay to visit the experimental rice fields in Fukuoka with Fujimori...More to come. _

He worked with a clear mind on the train — looking out the window and working. He finished very much and then realized he was almost there. Keep it simple, clean it up, finish the thing, he thought. He was almost there, then he was, then he was done. Jean Pierre closed his laptop and thought about the port and the horn. Fukuoka. 

## Chapter Three
----
The Old Fisherman Terukazu splashed water on Fujimori as their boats passed in the canal. 

"How did you find my secret spot?” Terukazu asked. 

“I promised I'd never tell” Akihiro Fujimori said with a grin. 

Fujimori trolled the two-man boat to a dock at the back of a hut. He tied it up, stepped onto the dock, removed his shoes and walked inside the house. Jean Pierre followed suit and the two cleaned up, and returned to the dock to clean fish. 

“Why do the coy fish live in this way here in the canal?” Jean-Pierre asked. 

“We feed them because we like the way they look. I bet you can not catch one with your hands, as I can.” Fujimori said. 

“Aki, you know damn well I've caught more fish with my hands than you.” Jean Pierre said with a grin. 

A group of coy were there next to the dock. The men looked down. Aki jumped in and did not flail about on the surface. He laid himself back to the bottom under the dock, and there with his eyes opened waited and caught no coy.

Aki back on the dock the water became calm again. The coy returned and the two men talked about rice.

## Chapter Four
----
The local rice master practiced a specific form of zen agriculture, called _do nothing_ from the Daosist _wu-wei_.  Whereby the practictioner puts seeds down together, seeds that grow symbiotic plants in balance. 

Barley and rice are planted among eachother on small plots of land in fall and in spring. The same vegetables in the hills. To cover the fields the farmer uses crimson clover. It shoots nitrogen into the soil and keeps weeds out. Brings in nice pollinators, helps prevent plant disease. That's really it. There is still much labor involved. Direct seeding — without using a large till, and manual weeding where necessary. The process revolves around a circular inlaid tea cooking dojo pit. Akihiro Fujimori brought Jean Pierre to the Masanobu farm.

Masanobu knew the tea ceremony and served it very well. This night he served tea from the pot of a visiting Britisher, a hiking thermos stamped MADE IN ENGLAND with the year 1945. The Britisher was tall and looked more like a Scott, a good highlander from the movies. He had a funny name, Dougal Roscoe Cameron III. The group accepted the tea as it was served in Masanobu's style. The pot was inspected by all and passed around the room. Each person to make a comment on the pot and pass it along. Masanobu last, Akihiro first.

“A year to remember.” Aki said.
“A canteen of tin.” Jean Pierre said.
“Burmese tin.” Said the Britisher.
“Japanese tea.” Said Masanobu. 

Tea was poured and handed across the circular inlaid fire part. Paper walls gave the feeling of sitting inside, tatami mats, clean as a whistle, under clean dojo clothes and clean feet.
