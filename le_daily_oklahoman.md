# The Daily Oklahoman
----

 > It was windy when I came in. I told the guard somebody turned the wind on and forgot to turn it off. He said the wind makes this visit special. 

> Senator Bergstrom was there with the guards and Senator Allen. They said call us by our names not Senator this or that and then we had coffee. Bergstrom adjusted his bolo tie and Mary Boren came out of the gift shop. We tipped our hats and said hello. 

> “Who took our hats?” Allen asked Bergstrom. 

> “Brooks, Bullard, or Burns, I reckon.” Bergstrom said. 

 > “Coleman, Dahm, and Dossett have new hats, no?” 

> “Indeed.” 

> “Two Dossetts?”

> “Yes. Married or related I don't know.”

> Dugger strolls past the pair. Past Boren, Brooks, Bullard, Burns and the rest. Coleman, Dahm, and the Dossetts on the other side. 

> “A family reunion? No?” Dugger asks with a smile. 

> The Dossetts laugh. The rest tip their hats and smile back. Dugger answers his phone.

> “Yes, ah, yes, okay. Oh the first floor. Why, I too...”

> Garvin throws a rock past Bullard and Boren, shattering the window of the gift shop.   

> Chuck Hall is hit with a piece of glass, picks it up off the ground and shaves the sides of Warren Hamilton’s beard off with the shard. John Haste picks up _The Oklahoman_ and reads patiently waiting for his turn. Carri Hicks takes a seat next to Haste and asks if he signed in online. 

> “I left my phone at home.”

> “Ah. Long drive.”

> “Yes, yes.”

> Brett Howard waits in line now because there is a line.

> “What’s the line for?” Howard asks the group.

> “Liberation.” Replies Shane Jett.

> The group nods. Haste produces two more copies of _The Oklahoman_ and the trio reads away. 

> “We’ll pass the funnies around each when we’re done so everybody can have a look.” Says Haste. 

> “This is democracy,” Chris Kidd said. 

> Kidd desires to wait in line but lacks a current edition of _The Oklahoman. _ He sets off to acquire a copy. Julia Kirt is just the senator he needs to see. He sets out for Kirt’s office on the fifth floor. A treacherous journey from the first. 

> At this point I realized the best seat in the house was the press box. _Visiting press_ seems appropriate. I must get my hands on a copy of _The Oklahoman_. They say it possesses some magical power. Something clicks when I see Chris Kidd push the button on the elevator. I know I must run up the stairs to the fifth floor to find the last current edition in the building in Julia Kirt’s office. This edition still has the funnies.
